Crypto-exchange API Transmogrifier

This is still in early development mode, being updated here and there.

The general idea is to wrap the APIs for the various exchanges (GDAX, Binance, etc) into a commond format for standard things like order book / market depth, current trade prices, candlestick stats, etc...

Any thoughts / feedback are appreciated.
